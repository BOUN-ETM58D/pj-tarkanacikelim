**Assignment1**

'_'Job Description'_':  I am working in a logistics company that is working with mainly electronics and white appliances producers like Vestel, TeknoSA, LG, Indesit etc. The company’s name is Tezel Logistics and I am currently working in Business Development Department. There are many small and big trucks go out for deliveries every day, so it is important to follow their volume(fullness) as it is costly if the trucks go out empty, and following deliveries to check if they are completed in lead times is also significant to achieve high KPI results.
